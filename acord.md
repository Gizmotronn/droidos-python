## About ACORD

ACORD Corporation, formerly known as the Alliance of Droids, was formed in December 2015 by Nicholas Antipas (current COO) and Liam Arbuckle (Chairman, @IrisDroidology). Our goals are to design and develop robots to help people in need and make scientific discoveries.

## DroidOS
One of our "robots" is called DroidOS. DroidOS is a suite of software that will be able to run on iOS (mobile Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads & iPods), Android, Windows, Mac, & Linux. This suite of apps will be used to do many things, such as:

* Build Robots - Designing (Autocad 2017)
* Develop Robots - Coding (Github, Notepad++, Pycharm, Microsoft Visual Studio)
* Project management 
* ACORD management - (ACORD app, Mozilla Firefox, Github)
* Games - (Star Sailors)

One of the things that DroidOS will do is to customize your device, such as adding widgets to your homescreen. These widgets will be able to show you information about your robot or pretty much anything, really. For Windows, we'll be using [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net)

## Python
Python is one of the best coding languages for simple games. Star Sailors, which is a book and RPG-series set in space, will be partially coded with Python. I'm currently in the progress of learning Python and I'll be talking about what I've learnt and my notes on the subject, which could be useful for anyone else wanting to learn Python.
