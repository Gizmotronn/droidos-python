# Python - Sololearn Basic Concepts

## What we learn
* In Python, we use the print statement to output text - print("This is an example")
* We use quotation marks around text that should be outputed in the console

## Welcome to Python
* Python is a high-level programming language.
* It has applications in numerous areas (for example, web programming, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence)
* Used by companies such as Disney, NASA, & Google

* There are three major versions of Python - 1.xx, 2.xx, and 3.xx
* They are subdivided into minor versions (e.g.1.1)
* Code written for Python 3 is guaranteed to work for all future versions
* Python 2 & Python 3 are currently used
* An interpreter is a program that runs scripts written in an interpreted language such as python

### Questions
* Python is a *programming language*

* Which of these statements are true *Cpython is an implementation of Python*

## Your first program
* In Python, we use the print statement to output text
* We use quotation marks around text that should be outputed in the console
* We can either use "xx" or 'xx'
* The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text - see CODE (Your first program)

### Questions
* Fill in the blanks to print "Hi" - *print*("Hi")

## Simple Operations
* Python is capable of conducting simple calculations
* You can enter a calculation directly into Python and it will output the result for you  (see CODE (Simple operations))
* Python also carries out multiplication and division. 
* Python uses the * (shift+8) key for multiplication and the / (forward slash) key for division
* Parantheses () are used to determine which operations are performed first
* The minus sign indicates a negative number
* Operations are also performed on negative numbers
* Dividing by zero in Python gives an error as no number can be divided by zero

### Questions
* What does this code output? (1+2+3) *6*
* What is output by this code? ((4+8)/2) *6.0*

# Code Examples

## Your first program

```print("Hello World")
print("Second sentence")
```

## Simple Operations
```2+2
Result = 4
```
