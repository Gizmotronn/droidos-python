Welcome to the DroidOS Python Page. This page is full of everything that you need to know to get the best open-source software suite for robots and personal computing devices.

DroidOS is a software suite owned and operated by ACoRD (Australian Corporation of Robotic Development) for our robots and games. ACORD is responsible for a number of games, including Haunted & Star Sailors. 

Python is a programming language that is very good for making 2-D games. This repository is for us to show you how to use Python while we learn the nitty-gritty components of the programming language. It is also for us to share the python parts of DroidOS and for you to improve on it. We're happy to have you on board.
